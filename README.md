# Udacity's Project 5: Neighborhood Map

## Project Goal
To create a single page application, specifically an interactive map, that must incorporate highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Jillian's New York City Tour
For my project, I created a New York City "tour" that pulls information about tourist hotspots from FourSquare to provide the user with information about the location.

## Running the App
Download a zip of the project and open index.html in your browser. Users can search by name which will filter the markers on the map and location names in the list view. Clicking on the filtered marker or name in the list view will open the info window with the Foursquare information and cause the the marker to bounce twice and stop. Users can also use the list view for filtering. Clicking on a name of a location in the list view will open the info window of clicked location also causing the marker to bounce twice and stop.
